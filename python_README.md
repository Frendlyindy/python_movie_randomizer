# Overview

I wanted to refresh my skills with python as it has been six months or so since I have used it. I also wanted to work better with reading and editing files.
I have made a movie randomizer and file reader and writer. The program lets me add movies to a file, read them, and randomly choose a movie to watch. I chose to make this becuase my wife and I own a lot of movies and we have a hard time picking one to watch.
